# Prototype Status

## Built

- Third-person controller: WASD movement, Left Shift run, Space jump.
- Flight: hold `F` while airborne. Flight has 6.0 seconds of fuel and refills at 2.5 fuel/second while grounded.
- Super-strength punch: left mouse or `E`. It has 3 charges, a 0.45-second cooldown, and recovers a charge every 1.25 seconds.
- Tiny physics arena generated at play time with crates, barrels, and stacked objects. Punches use `Rigidbody.AddForce` / `AddExplosionForce`; props retain physics and can break apart from sufficiently hard impacts.
- HUD provides live numbers for fuel, charges, cooldown, force applied, and last punch outcome.

## Verification controls

Enter Play Mode, then press `V` to run the built-in deterministic validation sequence. It prints concrete telemetry to the Console and shows it in the HUD: flight fuel is sampled at 6.000, 4.000, and 0.000 seconds; it then demonstrates ground recharge. The punch test records three successful charged punches, a rejected zero-charge punch, a rejected cooldown attempt, then a recovered successful punch. The force test prints the exact configured force (1350 N) and affected rigidbody count.

The verifier drives the same resource and punch methods used by gameplay; it is deliberately available in the running prototype so the values can be checked alongside the actual physics response.

## Procedural animation pass

- Added collider-free arms and contrasting fists to the existing capsule. A successful punch snaps the right shoulder forward and pitches/twists the body, then eases to rest. Rejected cooldown/empty-charge attempts do not animate.
- Moving flight pitches forward; hovering or ascending without horizontal travel levels out. Ground movement leans in the actual local travel direction, with a small distance-driven vertical bob that fades at rest.
- A landing event reports downward impact speed from the actual CharacterController movement. Falls above the minimum impact threshold produce a quick foot-pivot squash, slight widening, backward tilt, and recovery. Sub-skin-width resting contact transitions are filtered from the event; light impacts also do not trigger the animation.
- All animation timing, angle, intensity, speed thresholds, and blend rates are Inspector-editable in `Assets/Resources/ProceduralAnimationTuning.asset`. Select that asset in the Project window; edits take effect during Play Mode. Asset edits persist, so undo unwanted experiments. Defaults: punch attack/recovery 0.065/0.240s, arm rotation -100 degrees; flight lean 48 degrees; run lean 10 degrees and bob 0.045m; landing compression/recovery 0.055/0.240s and maximum squash 22%.
- Existing gameplay constants remain in `PrototypeTuning.cs`. Animation configuration is a ScriptableObject rather than C# constants because constants cannot be edited in the Inspector.
- `ProceduralHeroAnimation` only writes visual children. The controller publishes `PresentationState`, `PunchStarted`, and `Landed`; a future Animator adapter can subscribe to those same signals without changing ability logic. Disable/remove the procedural component when replacing it; disabling restores the resting pose. No animation clips or Animator controller were introduced.
- Scope: this pass implements the four requested placeholder animations. The attached broader city/powers/progression brief was treated as background, not implemented in this animation pass. Existing package edits are not part of this commit.

### Animation verification

`Assets/Editor/ProceduralAnimationVerification.cs` is a reproducible Unity batch Play Mode check. Run Unity with `-batchmode -projectPath <project> -executeMethod ProceduralAnimationVerification.Run -logFile <log>` (omit `-quit`; the check exits with its result). It samples controlled animation states, checks successful/rejected real punch calls, and then lets the real controller fall onto the arena. Output is written to `Verification/Animation/results.txt`; with graphics enabled it also renders six pose samples. This check is separate from the original `V` resource demo above.

Actual verification on Unity 6000.6.0f1, in a temporary project copy to preserve the open editor session: 20 checks passed, process exit 0. Recorded results and six inspected rendered poses are in `Verification/Animation/`.

- Successful punch: 100.000-degree arm rotation at 0.065s; recovered to rest. Cooldown and zero-charge controls emitted no additional punch event.
- Moving flight: 48.000-degree pitch; hover/vertical-ascent control: level. Diagonal run: pitch/roll +7.071/-7.071 degrees; bob over 120 steps: 0.0000–0.0450m; idle bob faded to zero.
- Controlled full-strength landing: scale (1.100, 0.780, 1.100), -13.000-degree backward tilt; weak-contact control remained unsquashed.
- Actual 5m controller fall: exactly one landing event, 13.117m/s impact, minimum visual Y scale 0.820, recovery to 1.000. Controller height remained 1.800m. All controlled poses preserved physics-root position, rotation, and scale. Disabling the component restored the resting pose.

Limits: deterministic pose samples and an actual automated fall were verified; no human keyboard/mouse feel session was performed. Unity compiled the scripts successfully, but the editor log included existing deprecated object-lookup warnings and a UnityEditor.Search startup indexing exception; these did not prevent the Play Mode checks from passing. No city/progression work or gameplay-resource re-verification is claimed by this pass.
